      <h1>About Us</h1>
			<h2>Kalam is a party of innovation. Kalam is a conglomerate of highly motivated mechanical engineers who have passion and desire to solve different problems, build team and leverage each other’s expertise to go ahead and build a solution. Obstacles have never been obstructing our effort to succeed. We do not reject our traditions but have a will to change circumstances. We design, we develop, we build and hence we learn. We learn from our opportunities, we learn from our faults and we learn from our work. We believe that there is no such thing as “End-point”.</h2>
			<h2>               We follow the insights of Dr A.P.J Abdul Kalam the “Missile Man of India” a great leader, scientist and above all an extraordinary human being.</h2>
			<h2>     “Dreams are not what you see in sleep. They are the things that do not let you sleep.”</h2>
			<h2>-      Dr A.P.J Abdul Kalam</h2>
